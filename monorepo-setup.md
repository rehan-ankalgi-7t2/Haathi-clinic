To create a monorepo that combines both **Next.js** (for frontend) and **NestJS** (for backend), you can use tools like **Nx** or **Turborepo** to manage the monorepo structure efficiently. Below is a guide using **Nx** as it provides easy integration for both Next.js and NestJS.

### Steps to Create a Next.js + NestJS Monorepo Using Nx:

1. **Install Nx CLI:**
   You can use Nx to scaffold and manage the monorepo easily. First, install the Nx CLI globally.

   ```bash
   npm install -g nx
   ```

2. **Create a New Nx Workspace:**
   Initialize a new Nx workspace with the `--preset=next` option to include a Next.js application in your workspace.

   ```bash
   npx create-nx-workspace@latest
   ```

   It will prompt you for some configurations:
   - **Workspace name**: e.g., `nextjs-nestjs-monorepo`
   - **Preset**: Select `Next.js`
   - **Application name**: Name your Next.js app (e.g., `web`)

   After this step, you will have a Next.js app set up.

3. **Add NestJS to the Workspace:**
   Now that you have the Next.js app, you can add a NestJS API.

   ```bash
   nx g @nrwl/nest:application api
   ```

   This will generate a NestJS application called `api` inside your workspace.

4. **Configure Next.js and NestJS in the Monorepo:**
   Both Next.js and NestJS will be placed in separate directories under the `apps/` folder:
   - `apps/web/` → Your Next.js app
   - `apps/api/` → Your NestJS app

5. **Linking Frontend and Backend:**
   - If you need to make requests from your Next.js frontend to the NestJS backend, you can use **Axios** or **fetch** in the frontend and configure the **API routes** accordingly.
   - Ensure that you properly set the backend URL in the frontend to point to your NestJS API (usually `http://localhost:3000` for Next.js and `http://localhost:3333` for NestJS in development).

6. **Run Both Applications:**
   You can run both the frontend and backend simultaneously using Nx.

   To run the Next.js app:

   ```bash
   nx serve web
   ```

   To run the NestJS app:

   ```bash
   nx serve api
   ```

   Nx will set up the necessary environment to serve both apps, each on its own port.

7. **Add Shared Libraries (Optional):**
   If you want to share code between the frontend and backend (like DTOs, types, or services), Nx allows you to generate shared libraries.

   ```bash
   nx g @nrwl/workspace:lib shared-types
   ```

   You can import these shared libraries in both the `web` and `api` applications.

8. **Configure Turborepo (Optional):**
   If you prefer using Turborepo instead of Nx for task caching and parallel execution, you can install Turborepo and configure the workspace accordingly. The steps would be slightly different but similar in concept.

### Monorepo Structure:

After completing the steps, your directory structure will look something like this:

```
apps/
  ├─ web/   # Next.js frontend
  ├─ api/   # NestJS backend
libs/       # Shared libraries (optional)
```

This monorepo setup allows you to manage both your frontend and backend from a single codebase, making development and deployment easier.
